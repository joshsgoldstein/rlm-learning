Classify this user message as RESEARCH or CHAT.

RESEARCH = the question requires searching or reading from the loaded document corpus (e.g. "what are the trends across reports", "compare the findings", "find details about X in the documents").
CHAT = the question does NOT require the document corpus. This includes:
  - Conversational follow-ups answerable from chat history (e.g. "summarize that", "thanks", "explain more").
  - General knowledge questions unrelated to the documents (e.g. "how do I take a screenshot", "what is Python", "what year is it").
  - Meta questions about the tool itself (e.g. "what commands are available", "how does this work").

If in doubt, ask: "Would searching the PDF corpus help answer this?" If no, classify as CHAT.
